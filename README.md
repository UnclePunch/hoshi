# hoshi

**hoshi** is a powerful and flexible modloader designed for Kirby Air Ride (NTSC). 

---

## Features

- **Mod File Loading**  
  **hoshi** automatically detects and loads all compatible mod binaries placed in the `mods` folder on the game disc. Modders do not need to hardcode any mod paths or registration logic. **hoshi** handles discovery and initialization automatically.

- **Code Hooking**  
  Define callback functions for injecting code at key points in game execution.

- **Unique Save File System**  
  **hoshi** creates and manages its own save file, automatically handling save slots for each mod.

- **Custom Settings Menu**  
  Add your own toggles and menus to a shared in-game settings menu, allowing users to easily configure your mod.

- **Scene Injection Support**  
  Register new major and minor scenes to integrate fully with the gameâ€™s flow and scene manager.

## Installation

1. Place the [hoshi.bin](https://github.com/UnclePunch/hoshi/raw/refs/heads/main/out/release/hoshi.bin) in the root directory of your NTSC Kirby Air RIde iso.

2. Install the entrypoint [gecko code](https://github.com/UnclePunch/hoshi/blob/main/entrypoint/out/codes.txt) or [.gct file](https://github.com/UnclePunch/hoshi/blob/main/entrypoint/out/codes.gct) by your preferred means. This will kickstart the hoshi framework. I recommend using the .gct with [@JoshuaMKW](https://github.com/JoshuaMKW)'s [GeckoLoader](https://github.com/JoshuaMKW/GeckoLoader/releases), as it is a reliable and permanent installation within your .dol file.
