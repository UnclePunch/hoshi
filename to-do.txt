- Settings
    - OptionDesc instead of MenuDesc?

- Save Prompt
    - ask the user if they would like to play with everything unlocked upon save creation
    - if no memory card is inserted, unlock everything

- Modloader
    - allow mods to link against other mods functions? lots of strings... maybe i hash
    - re-init all mod save data when deleting all in settings

- Buildtool
    - index reloc symbol offsets/addresses, should save a good amount of mem
    - implement debug strings

Misc:
- FGM pitch can be adjusted dynamically in debug menu?
